        <div class="well">
            <p>I received my BS in Computer Science in 2013 from Isfahan University of Technology in Isfahan, Iran. I am currently studying PhD at Wayne State University. My research interests are Parallel Computing, GPGPU and Game design. Currently working on <a href="http://gomc.eng.wayne.edu/">GOMC</a> project which is an open-source Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulation engine. In general I am interested in general-purpose computing on GPUs and optimization methods. Our objective is to use GPUs for different variety of computational problems. My Curriculum Vitae and all of my information is available in <a href="upload/CV.pdf">PDF format</a>.<p>

                <dt>GOMC Project (Current)</dt>
                <dd>GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC) is an open-source Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulation engine.  This code is developed for the simulation of vapor-liquid equilibria for systems containing tens of thousands of interaction sites. This project is a joint inter-departmental project between the Multicore Computing Lab in the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University and Professor Potoff's group from the Department of Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at Wayne State University.</dd>

                <dt>DSI Studio Project (Fall 2015)</dt>
                <dd>DSI Studio is an open source diffusion MRI analysis tool. It has been used in several human and animal studies to map brain connections and correlate diffusion MRI findings with diseases. The following features have been done by me:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Independent Component Analysis + Ball Stick Model (ICA+BSM)</li>

                <dd>My final project for CSC 5250 - Network, Distributed, and Concurrent Programming
                    <br>In this project a garage door which simulated by a raspberry pi can be controlled by an app on your phone using a secured SSL connection.<br>
                    Files for this project can be download here.

                <dd>My final project for CSC 7290 - Advanced Computer Networking<br>
                    In this project I have simulated a WSN which dynamically reconfigures to change some of the configuration of each node. This method can also be used to dynamically generate a network based on different topologies like star.<br>
                    Full report of this project can be found here.

                <dd>My final project for CSC 6290 - Data Communication and Computer Networks<br>
                    There is a trade off between hard coding or retransmission of messages in a computer network. In this project I have studied the impact of focusing on each of these methods.<br>
                    Full report of this project can be found here, also the code for this project available here.

                <dd>This website is designed to share schedules, arrange a meeting or sign-up for volunteer events. Features like edit, delete, invite and tracking invitations is available. This project was done for The Medical Education Support Group at 2014 and can be used by Wayne State students and staff.
